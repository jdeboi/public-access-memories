FA Sysfont C is a modern re-creation of Chicago typeface, created in 1984 by Susan Kare for Apple's operating system named System (MacOS's precursor).

Manually drawn from scratch as pixel art in Adobe Illustrator by Alina Sava from FontsArena.com. Font files generated with FontSelf for Illustrator. Diacritics and symbols were complete guesswork, so they might be different than the original font.

Manually kerned (though there is room for improvement).

Free for both personal and commercial use, licensed under SIL OpenFont license.
