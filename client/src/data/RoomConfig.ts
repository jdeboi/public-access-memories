Her work has spanned between virtual spaces, video projection, and painting on real and digital canvases. Additionally, her work often contains digital elements and thematic ties to her home of Texas, her adolescence in Southeast Asia, and her Indian heritage. Her current explorations revolve around collecting as a form of reflection and the parallels between natural and human-made identities and the environments they encompass.", bio: "Mitchell Craft is a 3D Artist based in Brooklyn, NY.",

        description: 'This webpage presents a series of digital images derived from the same source image - an undated family photograph, taken likely before I was born. I began creating new versions of this particular image in 2013 by dragging only the sky portion of the photograph across a flatbed scanner. The distorted scans are random, painterly, and suggest a deep space, though smudges and fingerprints are apparent on the surface of the scanner glass. Over time, I returned to my original scans, reinterpreting them as variable elements of miniature installations - printed on fabric, encased in acrylic, and reflected across mirrors and compact discs. \nFor flatbed___, images of these small arrangements overlay newly made scans, incorporating physical elements and visual qualities of one another â€“ becoming transparent, opaque, blurry, shifting, rotating, and disappearing. This layering and collaging of materials and images resembles the impermanence and randomness of memory, floating in and out at any given moment, and infinitely open to revision. Technology may promise a sense of permanence, but even devices remember things imperfectly, or forget, over time.',

        description: "Cursor Echo is a website featuring an interactive live streamed video in which visitors' mouse movements are temporarily recorded through a feedback loop. The distortion and compression of the live stream causes the recorded gestures to degrade over time, eventually fading into a cloud of pixelated noise artifacts. This work reflects ideas of digital memory-making in the way it deals with information storage. The data of visitors' cursor positions are never explicitly recorded in any concrete way. Instead the information circles within a digital eddie, repeatedly being sucked back into the loop until it disintegrates completely. For me this closely parallels the idea that memories are not discrete items to be accessed like files on a computer, but exist more like a system which rewrites itself on each activation.",

The audio overlayed connects memories of eating the dish from both my childhood home in Michigan to my family's home in the Philippines. After the web program is initiated, the site endlessly spawns new windows until the amount of processing power causes the computer to overwhelm and the browser to eventually collapse, freeze and deprecate; mimicking my inability to understand or to make sense of the unanswered questions of the origins of this dish.",
