          In 2019, an archeologist from the University of Astarkhan, a city on
          the Russian steppe with a name identical to the artist’s last name,
          unearthed a benchmark finding - the legendary Khazar city of Atil – a
          modern Atlantis. The Khazars were Judeo-Turkic tribes converted from
          Tenegri Shamanism - a belief in the titular sky god and the eternal
          blue sky - into monotheistic religions. The story of their conversion
          to Judaism, “The Kuzari”, is a core text in Jewish Philosophy.
          However, all three Abrahamic religions were practiced freely and
          harmoniously within the Khazar kingdom.
        </p>
        <p>
          Astarhan’s long-term research of the ancient kingdom utilizes
          technology to re-figure Khazar myths, depict alter-zionist histories
          of the Jewish diaspora and his own ancestry, and reach back to a time
          and place where religious divides were not obstacles to a flourishing
          community and culture. They gather videos and images of objects from
          the archeological dig and model them in 3D, creating an object
          database to imagine Khazar pasts and futures.
        </p>
        <p>
          Khazar Archeological Confabulations uses line-drawing object
          renderings from the archive to generate a synthetic image database. It
          then employs machine learning to craft speculative archeological
          object drawings. The AI process is home-brewed, subverting hi-fi and
          photorealistic AI imagery. The results are abstract membrane,
          cell-like images, calling for a projection of what such a past and
          future might entail. The images are then turned into Cyanotypes
          exposed to natural light, reflecting Khazar Tenegrist myths of the
          titular sky god and the eternal blue sky.

        My works are thought experiments in sculpture, installation, and media
        art, often incorporating digital technology and electronic mechanisms to
        create reactive systems and interactive experiences. Through
        collaborations and a research-based practice, I learn, teach, and create
        a physical encounter with how hidden power structures shape our
        relationship with technology and history. My works reveal what's
        deliberately obscured from human perception - whether in digital
        interfaces or dominant Western narratives. Working with raw industrial
        materials and responsive elements, I create work that engages with
        environmental conditions and exposes the physical foundations of
        technological systems. Drawing parallels between ancient spiritual
        relationships to nature and our contemporary technological devotions, I
        examine how belief systems - from shamanic sky worship to artificial
        intelligence - shape our understanding of energy, power, and progress.
        Through these investigations of overlooked histories and imagined
        futures, my operational and responsive works invite viewers to question
        conventional notions of ownership, labor, and our relationship to both
        ancestral and emerging technologies.

        explores threatened ecologies in the context of social conflicts,
        indigenous knowledges, and the ways language reproduces ideological
        assumptions. I work with the local environmental intelligence of rivers
        and oceans, studying the complex interactions between narrative,
        culture, and nature, as well as the interconnections between water and
        other organisms. What roles can art and technology play in addressing
        ecological crises? How can we extend empathy to nature? My goals revolve
        around investigating alternative uses of technology, especially machine
        learning and electronics, for ecological purposes, and demonstrating how
        digital media can nurture our coexistence with non-human agencies.
        Through my exploration, I contribute to interpretable AI and
        experimental storytelling strategies. I also investigate how
        culture—through social narrative, language, and communication—shapes our
        relationship with nature. I create transformative art projects that
        advocate for fairness and inclusion across all species, treating

          Flowers Blooming Backward Into Noise is a 20-minute animated
          “documanifesto” about AI art. It explains how Diffusion models work,
          as well as their entanglement with composite photography, statistical

          Eryk Salvaggio is an artist working critically with AI-generated
          media, using and subverting tools to reveal the problems embedded
          within them. As an artist working critically with technology, his work
          openly acknowledges its complicity. As such, the work is created
          through glitching the machines, repurposing generated imagery to
          emphasize biases or other problems, or highlighting the image’s
          relationship to its social, technical, and cultural context.

          Through video essays, sound art, and performance lectures, Salvaggio’s
          work confronts essential debates in AI, such as the politics of
          extraction, dehumanization, and information pollution that lay at
          their heart. “Many artists see AI as a tool for expanding the

          Feminist Data Set is a multi-year project that interrogates every step
          of the AI process that includes data collection, data labeling, data
          training, selecting an algorithm to use, the algorithmic model, and
          then designing how the model is then placed into a chat bot (and what
          the chatbot looks like). Every step exists to question and analyze the
          pipeline of creating using machine learning—is each step feminist, is
          it intersectional, does each step have bias and how can that bias be
          removed?
        </p>
        <p>
          Current projects under the Feminist Data Set umbrella include Feminist
          Data Set workshops, the Feminist Data Set Tool Kit, and TRK (an open
          source tool to address wage inequity in data training and data
          labeling). This project has been shown at LABoral, Ars Electronica,
          Victoria and Albert Museum, the Museum of Modern Arts Bologna, SPACE
          Art and Technology, RePublica, SOHO20 Gallery, as well as others.

        <p>
          More about the project: Feminist Data Set is a public facing, social
          justice art practice. For example, the collecting of feminist data is
          held through public workshops and forums. Feminist Data Set imagines
          data creation, as well as data sets and archiving, as an act of
          protest. In a time where so much personal data is caught and hidden by
          large technology companies, used for targeted advertising and
          algorithmic suggestions, what does it mean to make a data set about
          political ideology, one designed for use as protest and to make a data
          set as a community?
        </p>
        <p>
          Pedagogically, Feminist Data Set operates in a similar vein to Thomas
          Thwaites’s “Toaster Project,” a critical design project in which
          Thwaites builds a commercial toaster from scratch. Feminist Data Set,
          however, takes a critical and artistic view on software, particularly
          machine learning. What does it mean to thoughtfully make machine
          learning, to carefully consider every angle of making, iterating, and
          designing? Every step of this process needs to be thoroughly
          re-examined through a feminist lens.

          I am a research-based transdisciplinary artist working across digital
          and traditional media, focused on the trans body as a site of
          political violence and potential. Much of my work starts with
          formulating and addressing questions. Through this process, I begin to
          create the objects, scenes, and interactions that form the basis of
          new works. These questions stem from my lived experience as a
          transwoman in the United States and long term fixation with the
          politics of visibility. More specifically, I am focused on the trans
          body as a site of contemporary productions of the inhuman, and of
          violence (physical, emotional, institutional, and otherwise) committed
          in the ongoing effort to reify gender as a binary system. These
          questions and explorations are centered around a critical engagement
          with current and historical systems of codification and control, to
          draw the viewer into an affective exploration of what it means to
          inhabit a fluid body subjected to colonial logics of visualization
          meant to fix, delineate, and stabilize.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my practice, I am deeply invested in material specificity,
          leveraging the inherent qualities (which are always contested and
          culturally situated) of materials is a central part of my practice.
          With technical knowledge that includes code, video, digital
          fabrication, traditional sculptural processes, writing, and
          bookbinding, I move works across and through different materials and
          processes to explore their formal and conceptual potential. This
          process enacts “trans-” as a tactic and gesture for art making.

          “Consensus Sensing” is a continuation of my series of investigative
          experiments into the transphobia baked into AI image general. This
          project will expand my image series "Consensus Portraits" into an
          online interactive archive. "Consensus Portraits" is a series of
          portraits of trans and non-binary people, generated with popular
          generative AI tools. It has long been known that biases contained
          within datasets surface in generative “AI” systems trained on this
          data. The generated images in this series highlight the transphobic
          tropes baked into so-called AI systems and contain subtle tells about
          the source imagery used in their creation.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Consensus Sensing” will present this archive of AI images within an
          online custom user interface containing footnotes, context, and
          overlays, inviting viewers to closely read the images. Invested in
          looking critically at the data and process obscured by the black box,
          “Consensus Sensing” will offer the audience an opportunity to slow
          down their viewing and glimpse the inside of the black box.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this work culminates in an online
          interactive space containing a gallery of images, critical and
          descriptive texts, and custom UI elements.

          Rodell Warner is a Trinidadian artist working primarily in new media
          and photography, and a Moving Image master’s student at Bard College.
          Rooted in the exploration of race, nature, and technologies of
          representation, Rodell's artworks draw on personal and institutional
          archives to rethink the past, and on digital processes to index
          emancipatory futures. Rodell's digital animations intervening in early
          photography from the Caribbean have been exhibited at the Art Gallery
          of Ontario in the landmark exhibition{" "}
          <em>Fragments of Epic Memory</em> in 2022, and in 2024 in the Tito's
          Prize solo exhibition <em>Fictions More Precious</em> at Big Medium in
          Austin, Texas. Rodell’s <em>TERRARIA ⚘</em> - animated works showing
          hand-modeled digital 3D renderings of site-identified plant species
          seen through unique lenses in virtual environments - has been
          exhibited at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Taipei in{" "}
          <em>NEXUS－Video and New Media Art from the Caribbean</em> in 2023,
          and in 2024 at the Pérez Art Museum Miami in the exhibition Sea

          My practice is multidisciplinary and rooted in collective action. I
          move between artistic creation, design, writing, curating, and
          community organizing, weaving together archives, digital media, and
          public space interventions as strategies that invite reflection on
          memory, state violence, and exile.
        </p>
        <p>
          My creative process has been nourished by the urgent need to
          reconstruct and dignify the memory of those killed by the Nicaraguan
          state, as I have been a victim/survivor of state violence myself, from
          a place of dignity and exile. I investigate and experiment with
          expanded forms of media to design community based projects
          (transmedia, interactive and public interventions), that document and
          archive memories of human rights violations, denounce injustices, and
          worldbuild alternative futures.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through my work, I foster the creation of networks of collaboration,
          care, and solidarity that—through tenderness and mutual support—resist
          the multiple political, authoritarian, and patriarchal adversities
          that mark Central America. My interest lies in how these networks
          become forms of resistance against official narratives of oppression
          and forgetting.
        </p>
        <p>
          My motivation arises from a deep commitment to transformative justice,
          aiming to challenge colonial, state and para-state violence,
          militarization, police repression, prisons, borders, and other racist
          technologies of death. I conceive of imagination as an essential
          political tool for creating more just, decolonial, and
          depatriarchalized futures.

          In Nicaragua, the government has denied the victims of state violence
          the right to truth, justice, and memory since 2018. “AMA y NO OLVIDA,”
          Museum of Memory Against Impunity, contributes to dignifying victims
          of state violence and honoring their memory, as well as countering the
          regime's impunity. It was created with a participatory approach
          involving all members of the Mothers of April Association (AMA), an
          organization of relatives of the victims' deaths.
        </p>
        <p>
          AMA y No Olvida is a transmedia community and participatory archive
          that holds more than 200 video testimonials, a photographic archive,
          memory artifacts, and hand-drawn maps that were turned into geographic
          information systems (GIS) digital maps that geo-localize the
          narratives of the murder of 100 victims, and an Interactive art book
          with an augmented reality component. The book I am proposing to
          exhibit, compiles around 100 stories of victims murdered by the
          regime, told through the voices of their families. It also shows
          augmented reality versions of 3D barricade shaped altars with memory
          objects that belonged to the victims.
        </p>
        <p>
          In conversation with Black, trans and decolonial scholars, I created a
          set of ethics of media representation and forms that I call “modular
          visibility”. Modular visibility counters impunity and state
          surveillance by actively refusing to make visible and reproduce the
          victims’ cruel deaths. It is as an activist strategy of refusal and
          opacity that problematize notions of access and open source to
          consider possibilities of data autonomy and self-governance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead, it emphasizes the victims' absence and their families
          struggle for recognition, and making that absence into a political
          statement. With the disappearance of public acts of protest and
          mourning in Nicaragua, this project allows the victims' stories to
          transcend their homes and families to transform public and private
          spaces into places of collective memory.
