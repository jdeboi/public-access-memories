      "The mediums I use mostly are websites and writing. In both those mediums, my creative practice is twofold. After an extended period in college where I bought into techno-solutionism, I became interested in the critical and noncritical applications of work that has little to no value whatsoever. A big part of my creative web (and writing) practice is creating strictly for creative expression, to answer my own questions about the world or to channel my emotions into something tangible.<br/>The second thread that runs through my practice has to do with interrogating the mundane and embedded parts of society.Through writing as well as scraping, gathering and displaying data I try to highlight elements of Nigerian and American culture that tend to go unexamined.",

      "The last year or so, I have been doing an archival research project with a local archive retrieving and processing files from a 1990s Bulletin Board System (BBS). This involves reading hundreds of pages of posts and comments, which contain shitposts, arguments, personals, and the like. The BBS, which is intended for gay men, is a remnant of online gay culture during the AIDS epidemic. As part of this research, I have been reflecting on the fragmentation caused by that event. The AIDS epidemic existed parallel to the Internet boom. As physical cruising locations were shut down and disrupted, the digital world became a location for connection. <br/> My art always exists alongside writing, and I recently published a piece regarding the history of a specific location in Chicago which has a history of gay cruising (www.sixtyinchesfromcenter.org/among-the-bushes). I am interested in expanding on those ideas, creating a ‚Äúvirtual cruising‚Äù space, both didactic and interactive, full of (digital) trees. Hidden in the binary foliage are historic ‚Äúpersonals,‚Äù either verbatim or based on the types of posts on the BBS. I imagine other assets among them ‚Äì such as LiDar scans of people‚Äôs bodies, disrupted and obscured. <br/>Rather than a static archive, I see this as a garden that the patrons can wander through, simulating the environment of a cruisy park, but containing information, image and text, related to the subject of cruising, the AIDS epidemic, and online community. <br/>Using PAM‚Äôs virtual space, I can explore the possibilities of an embodied engagement with digital history. I am excited by PAM‚Äôs offer to experiment with the virtual gallery, and I would use this opportunity to play with navigation, layering, and obfuscation, making the environment itself reflective of the act of cruising.",
    bio: "Emrys Brandt is a trans-disciplinary artist and writer based in Chicago, IL, on the unceded land of the Ojibwe, Potawatomi, and Odawa peoples. Enamored with the language of a document, he collects and records information, histories, and natural phenomena. At times collaborator, playmate, and critic, he often re-presents these collections to poetically address technologies that deal in collection, identification, and modification. Working across digital and physical media ‚Äì including browser art, physical computing, and text ‚Äì he explores memory, queerness, and invisible phenomena, both digital and natural.",

      "I am interested in memories, how we make and share them and how to distribute them among multiple actors. For the last few years I have been working on creating a decentralised body and network of myself. This ‚Äúnetwork of Amandas‚Äù, with nodes spread across different cities (so far in Brussels, Berlin and Basel) is used to experiment on creating and sharing memories between different nodes and how to reconstruct these memories within nodes that did not experience them themselves.<br/>Many works rely on an involvement of the audience, making them owners, participators and collective decision-makers of my works. With this, I am able to reflect on authorship, vulnerabilities and the limits and possibilities of privacy and publicity as well as creating speculative ways of rethinking an individual.<br/>These experiments are interwoven with my fascination for systems created by technology and the abstraction and clarity they require. I explore these systems in order to mitigate power structures and distribution networks.<br/>The outcomes of these reflections entail every possible medium. Mostly, the works have gone through some stage of thinking about them from a perspective of software development. The outcomes are things like drawings, photographs, objects, installation, video, websites or NFTs.",
