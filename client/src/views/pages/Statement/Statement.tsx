                    <strong>home &lt;/body&gt;</strong> considers the spaces,
                    experiences, and ephemera of digital homemaking. From housekeeping
                    chores (decluttering desktops and inboxes) to nesting rituals
                    (websurfing for superlative sourdough starter), the meaning of home
                    is rapidly evolving.

                <p>
                    Beyond probing a new visual language, the exhibition encourages
                    critical observations that seek to uncover tensions of
                    digital denizenship, for example, the nature of home as a &ldquo;safe
                    haven&rdquo; in an age of surveillance capitalism, fake news, and
                    internet trolls. Particularly in the context of a global pandemic,
                    the paradox of home as both sanctuary and asylum, as both a confined
                    and liberated space, offers ample opportunity for reflection.
