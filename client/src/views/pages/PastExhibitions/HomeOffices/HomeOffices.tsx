              This is part of a conversation between two waiters in Ernest
              Hemingway‚Äôs short story ‚ÄúA Clean, Well-Lighted Place.‚Äù The older
              waiter suggests that people need places where they can see other
              people in a warm, welcoming environment. Digital artists (artists
              who use code, the internet, or computers as a medium) may create
              in dark-mode and dwell in proverbial basements, but their work and
              community needs places to exchange and congregate. Digital art has
              not been entirely left out of the museums and galleries that
              comprise ‚Äúthe art world,‚Äù but these spaces do not necessarily meet
              the needs of digital art. On the contrary, digital artists have
              had to conform to the physical settings when a virtual space is
              the intended one.
            </p>
            <p>
              Artwork that engages with the internet potentially loses something
              significant when it is contextualized in traditional art spaces.
              Artist Jenna deBoisblanc created Public Access Memories (PAM) to
              provide a place where digital art and internet art can be seen as
              intended, mostly from home, while enjoying contextualizing and
              community-building aspects of a physical gallery. PAM, like the
              caf√© in the story, provides net artists a space to connect with
              viewers.

          You are bodiless when you arrive at PAM. Choosing an avatar from a
          bank of emojis allows visitors to be embodied. You see other
          gallery-goers in the form of emojis floating about the space. When the
          gallery is closed, as it is between exhibitions, you land on an image
          of a desktop, the familiar display of icons on a home computer and,
          for Dave Greber‚Äôs solo exhibition, an image of a wooden desktop on
          which a book, Home Office (the exhibition title) sits. Your avatar can
          retrieve a glass of virtual wine from a table before moving through
          the exhibition.

          Prehistoric humans made art on cave walls. To this day, viewers stand
          where those artists stood in the dark. This ancient impulse to make
          art had nothing to do with a gallery system. Then agriculture
          happened, and private property, and eventually those with wealth and
          power filled their rooms with art, which had become a symbol of
          privilege. When palaces could no longer hold royal collections,
          outbuildings were built, the first galleries and museums. Academies
          formed, and they also became arbiters of taste and value in Western
          art. In the late nineteenth century, artists and dealers began to
          self-emancipate and form commercial galleries around the showing and
          selling of art, for the most part, paintings and drawings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Digital artists have been making and sharing their work since computer
          art arrived in the 1950s or 60s depending on who you ask. Like cave
          art, digital art was made from the impulse to create, using newly
          available technology rather than pigments or stone. Digital art has
          been shown in art museums and galleries, but the inescapable fact is
          that these spaces were developed to house and exhibit objects. This is
          the context into which digital art has tried to fit in.
        </p>
        <p>
          The white cube model of a gallery provides not only space, but
          context, signifying that what‚Äôs inside its walls holds meaning beyond
          its raw material, beyond its face value. In the expanse of the
          internet, digital artists need spaces to show their work, and to
          connect and belong. PAM provides a welcoming, well-lighted space.

          The Call From Inside the Home Office: Dave Greber‚Äôs HomeOffices at
          Public Access Memories
        </h3>
        <p>
          The 2020 pandemic lockdown left its mark on our collective psyche and
          changed the shape of certain corners of our lives. While many were
          suddenly out of work, others were forced to merge work and home lives,
          blurring temporal and spatial boundaries, turning tables into desks
          and small rooms into offices. When the lockdown ended, many jobs
          continued on a work-from- home or hybrid structure. Even those whose
          work lives were not directly upended by the pandemic, the employer
          assumption that workers are available outside work hours has been
          normalized. There is no consensus about whether the shift toward a
          work-from-home economy has done more harm than good for individuals
          and families. Dave Greber‚Äôs exhibition of interactive digital
          collages, HomeOffices, suggests there is something grotesque about
          this grafting of work and home, grotesque but laced with
          culture-deprecating humor.
        </p>

        <p>
          Arriving at the online gallery, Public Access Memories, we find
          ourselves looking at the desktop of a home computer whose wallpaper is
          a picture of a desk on which sits a worn, softcover book titled Home
          Offices. Visitors select an emoji avatar. Other emojis may be floating
          about; these are other gallery-goers. As we mouse around the screen,
          images‚Äìa daisy, a pen, a yellow, rubber glove‚Äìappear and disappear
          under the cursor. We enter the exhibition at the bottom right corner
          and move through each image/installation this way like turning pages
          of a virtual book.
        </p>

        <p>
          The works in HomeOffices are based on images from a 1984 look book of
          office furniture. The originating interiors dense and airless, dated
          and bizarre. Making the strange stranger, the artist added
          objects‚Äìsome human or animal‚Äìto the scenes using AI. The image viewers
          encounter when they click into each space, is the final iteration of
          the collage. They can explore the images, which flicker and change
          revealing random-looking objects, which are the AI suggestions the
          artist dismissed. If you mouse over the globe on the desk, it becomes
          a basketball, then a cluster of balloons.
        </p>

        <p>
          This haunted history of rejected versions is one of many ways the work
          is deeply layered. Avatars proceed though virtual rooms that can be
          understand as collages or spatially as virtual installations. An
          avatar, representing a whole person, moves through the space
          suggesting they are installations, but a binding seam passes
          vertically though some images, implying the rooms are two dimensional
          and we are looking in a book. Occasional objects appear to be placed
          on top of a page further confusing our viewpoint. Meanwhile, viewers
          access the exhibition from computers, most likely in their home space,
          possibly at a desk. This is the reality parfait the work creates,
          layering the viewer into its gaudy claustrophobia. In the unlikely
          event that a viewer feels underwhelmed, each installation-collage
          hosts an AI generated soundtrack related to the objects in the room
          and occasional pop-ups vie for our attention.
        </p>

        <p>
          The pandemic hastened our adoption of communication technologies and
          drove our work lives into all hours of the day in some Philadelphia
          Experiment-type, mutated collapse of time and space. Humans hardly
          have the time to ask essential questions like, what are we working
          for? And, Can we mute the discomfort by redecorating our offices? The
          playfulness and humor in HomeOffices, consistent with the artist‚Äôs
          larger body of work, is funny-dark. The nightmare-like deformities,
          vagueness, and misinterpretations of AI not only generate appropriate
          imagery, but provide an apt metaphor of the zeitgeist. Is artificial
          intelligence cool or scary? Will it help or hurt us? Art is the
          sometimes-uncomfortable mirror of how we are living and what we value.
          Is working from home working for us? Greber‚Äôs HomeOffices does not
          answer these questions, but it suggests the call is coming from inside
          the house.

        <h2>About the Artist</h2>
        <p>
          Dave Greber is a contemporary artist and educator based in Baltimore,
          MD, known for his innovative installations and multimedia projects
          that explore the intersection of technology, art, and everyday life.
          His work, exhibited extensively nationally and internationally, blends
          traditional and digital media to create immersive experiences that
          subvert everyday expectations. Recents projects include a large-scale
          public art commission with the MTA Arts and Design and a solo show at
          the Ogden Museum of Art. Greber's latest project, "HomeOffices," uses
          generative AI to satirically reimagine the corporate dream within the
          context of modern home offices, offering insightful commentary on
          today's work culture.
