A digital space to host, curate, analyze, and explore net art and other digital artifacts. Initially created by Jenna deBoisblanc ([@jdeboi](https://www.instagram.com/jdeboi/)), this gallery encourages collaboration! Feel free to suggest features, add changes, iterate, etc...  

This is a MERN stack (although haven't really implemented the mongo database yet..).
